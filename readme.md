Visualization Prototype Development to Demonstrate the Breadth and Depth of Electronic Health Record Data 
===============
Ahmad Aljadaan, Ross Lordon, Jacob Olsufka


After a bit of a delay, due to logistical issues obtaining the de-identified clinical, data we were able to begin developing our prototypes on May 26th. The main goal of our project was to develop a variety of data visualization methodologies to improve upon the ones currently on the Data QUEST ITHS website. In light of these, we as a group decided to each individually develop a different visualization utilizing a different methodology. This would ensure that the work was divided up equally. Additionally, we worked on the paper and poster collaboratively.

This is an example repository for the final project submission.  Put your abstract from your final paper here.

## Running Instructions

Put your running instructions here.  (Tell us how to open your visualization.) 

If your visualization is web-based,  it would be great if your submissions can be opened online. [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) is a good and easy way to put your visualization online so you can put your link here.  For example:

Access our visualization at http://cse512-15s.github.io/fp-jheer-domoritz-jsnydes/ or download this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` and access this from http://localhost:9000/.

(If you put your work online, please also write a [one-line description and add a link to your final work](http://note.io/1n3u46s) so people can access it directly from CSE512-15S page.)
