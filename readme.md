Visualization Prototype Development to Demonstrate the Breadth and Depth of Electronic Health Record Data 
===============
#### Collaborators: Ahmad Aljadaan, Ross Lordon, Jacob Olsufka

After a bit of a delay, due to logistical issues obtaining the de-identified clinical, data we were able to begin developing our prototypes on May 26th. The main goal of our project was to develop a variety of data visualization methodologies to improve upon the ones currently on the Data QUEST ITHS website. In light of these, we as a group decided to each individually develop a different visualization utilizing a different methodology. This would ensure that the work was divided up equally. Additionally, we worked on the paper and poster collaboratively.
