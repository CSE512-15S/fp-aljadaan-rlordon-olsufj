Visualization Prototype Development to Demonstrate the Breadth and Depth of Electronic Health Record Data

#### Collaborators: Ahmad Aljadaan, Ross Lordon, Jacob Olsufka

After a bit of a delay, due to logistical issues obtaining the de-identified clinical, data we were able to begin developing our prototypes on May 26th. The main goal of our project was to develop a variety of data visualization methodologies to improve upon the ones currently on the Data QUEST ITHS website. In light of these, we as a group decided to each individually develop a different visualization utilizing a different methodology. This would ensure that the work was divided up equally. Additionally, we worked on the paper and poster collaboratively.

###Abstract

In this project we assessed the current state of medical data visualization and created three prototype data visualizations for the UW ITHS Data QUEST team. Little research has been conducted in regards to medical data visualization techniques, standards, or applications. Additionally, the Data QUEST team has an immediate need for improved data visualization and interactions on their website. In light of this, we opted to develop three different visualization prototypes. The purpose of each is to allow researchers to quickly and effectively explore the data, while informing potential research questions or projects. In the future, these protypes will be used and refined by the Data QUEST team and eventually incorporated into their website.
