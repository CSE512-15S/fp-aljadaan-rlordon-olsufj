                <h3>Small Multiples</h3>
                <p>A small multiple approach to displaying demographic breakdowns for the six largest clinics in the northwest. The aggregated demographic breakdown showing the overall breakdown is shown in the large box to the left. This visualization is intended to allow the user to explore differences between the clinics, and gain an understanding for the diversity of the patient data. For example, if a user is interested in data from a clinic with a high percentage of Asian patients, this can quickly support that task.

                <h3>Force Bubble Diagram</h3>
                <p>The force bubble diagram attempts to allow the user to explore the size of the data, and how the patients are broken up between different demographics. It is meant to be a fun and engaging experience, that serves an exploratory task, and hopefully garners further interest from a researcher looking to learn more about the dataset available.

                <h3>Stacked Bar Chart</h3>
                <p>The Stacked-to-Multiple visualization allows the user to navigate the clinical data for specific disease for different years. This display allows the user to navigate through the aggregate data of number of patients by selecting specific demographic criteria such as age, race or gender. Users can highlight trends that happened during the years for specific selecting group. For example, if the user is investigating the relationship between Lactose intolerance and Hispanic race they can find an answer for that.
