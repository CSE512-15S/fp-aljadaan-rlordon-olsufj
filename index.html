            <p>In this project we created three prototype data visualizations 
for the UW ITHS Data QUEST team. The Data QUEST team has an immediate need for improved 
data visualization and interactions on their website. In light 
of this, we opted to develop three different visualization 
prototypes. The purpose of each is to allow researchers to 
quickly and effectively explore the data, while influencing 
potential research questions or projects.</p>

                <h3>Small Multiples</h3>
                <p>One visualization method we pursued consisted of a small 

multiple approach to compare between clinics using bar 

charts. The purpose of this visualization is to allow 

researchers the ability quickly assess the demographics of 

all the clinics combined and for each individual clinic 

selected for analysis. The demographics included in the 

prototype are gender, race, ethnicity, and age. One larger 

multiple is displayed on the left hand side depicting the 

total for all the clinics currently being analyzed to the right 

of the larger multiple are the smaller multiples depicting the 

breakdown of the smaller clinics. Mouse over is 

incorporated into each bar in each chart to provide details 

on demand to the user.

                <h3>Force Bubble Diagram</h3>
                <p>The force bubble diagram allows the user to explore the

breadth and depth of the data in regards to the patients’

demographics. The purpose is to facilitate exploratory data 

analysis in a fun and engaging experience. It is our hope 

that this tool creates increased interest from a researcher 

looking to learn more about the dataset available. This 

interactive chart allows for two simultaneous user inputs for 

analysis. First, the bubbles can be sorted by the same 

demographic categories listed above for the small multiples 

visualization. Second, the user can color the dots to depict

the distribution of a second demographic variable within the 

clusters of the first demographic variable selected. The size 

of the bubbles represents the longevity of each patient’s 

time seen at the clinic. Details on demand are provided to 

the user through mouse over.

                <h3>Stacked Bar Chart</h3>
                <p>The stacked bar chart visualization allows the user to

navigate the clinical data for specific disease for different 

years. This display allows the user to navigate through the 

aggregate data by number of patients. This is accomplished 

by selecting from the same demographic options used in the 

previous examples. Users may find patterns that occurred 

during a specific time frame for a certain demographic 

diagnosed with a specific disease. For example, if a user 

wanted to see if more males than females were diagnosed 

with depression from 2012-2014, this visualization could

help researchers answer the question.
